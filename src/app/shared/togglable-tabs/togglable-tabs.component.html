    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active in fade" id="Bio"><p>After realizing my Business Degree I recently spent $65k of my "future" dollars (double that if you account for interest over a 20 year period of time) was going to set me on a depressing career, I decided change was necessary. I told myself, I needed to learn a skill other than Business. A skill that was going to be in demand for a while and something that I enjoyed doing. At the time I recently finished building my first “Hackintosh” and I had a lot of fun doing it. I had to edit some code so I could get the boot sequence of OSX to run correctly on my computer hardware.</p><p>This is when I started to learn more about programming, I was hooked. I started to realize that people that could program could build anything digital. It was like writing a spell that the computer could use to do some really cool things to engage the user. When I had this realization my mind was blown. I needed more! So I started learning how to use Adobe Dreamweaver, at the time this is all I knew what to use. I started doing tutorials learning how to build websites, learning what html tags were, how to style html with css, and then how to interact with the user with JavaScript.</p></div>
